## Preventive Health Monitoring & Early Risk Detection Framework

---

##  Overview

This repository contains the problem statement and conceptual foundation prepared for **Navonmesh Hackathon 2026**.

The focus of this project is to address the growing need for continuous preventive health monitoring and early risk detection in India, where chronic and lifestyle-related diseases are rapidly increasing.

##  Problem Statement

India is experiencing a significant rise in lifestyle-related and chronic conditions such as:

- Cardiovascular Diseases  
- Diabetes  
- Hypertension  
- Respiratory Disorders  

A large percentage of these conditions remain undiagnosed until they reach advanced stages due to:

- Limited routine monitoring  
- Low preventive awareness  
- Inadequate early-warning mechanisms  
- Fragmented personal health data  
- Accessibility barriers in semi-urban and rural regions  

Preventive healthcare in India remains largely **reactive rather than proactive**.

Many individuals do not undergo regular health checkups due to:

- Cost constraints  
- Infrastructure limitations  
- Lack of awareness  
- Digital divide across socio-economic groups  

As a result, preventable conditions often escalate into critical medical emergencies, increasing financial burden on families and strain on public healthcare systems.

##  Key Systemic Challenges

- Absence of real-time or continuous health parameter tracking at scale  
- Limited early identification of high-risk individuals  
- Fragmented personal health data across providers  
- Lack of actionable insights for preventive intervention  
- Digital divide across linguistic and socio-economic groups  
- Limited integration between individual health metrics and public health systems  

---

##  Challenge Statement

Design an innovative and scalable preventive health monitoring framework that:

- Enables early detection of potential health risks  
- Promotes proactive and preventive care  
- Bridges accessibility and digital gaps  
- Strengthens long-term health outcomes  
- Supports diverse Indian populations across urban and rural environments  

---

##  Expected Impact

The proposed framework should aim to:

- Reduce late-stage diagnosis of chronic diseases  
- Enable early risk stratification  
- Improve preventive healthcare awareness  
- Reduce long-term healthcare costs  
- Support public health decision-making through data-driven insights
