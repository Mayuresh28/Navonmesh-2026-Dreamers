PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE APPLICATION
UI DESIGN FLOW AND SYSTEM GUIDELINES
Mobile-First | Pastel Light Theme | Minimal Aesthetic

OBJECTIVE

Design a mobile-first, fully responsive healthcare monitoring interface using a pastel-based light theme. The interface must be minimal, aesthetic, structured, and clinically trustworthy while remaining visually soft and modern.

This document defines the complete UI flow and design expectations. Development implementation is not included in this phase. The agent must strictly follow these design considerations before any code generation.

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

2.1 Visual Identity

Calm and trustworthy

Professional but approachable

Clean and minimal

Data-focused but human-centered

Modern health-tech aesthetic

2.2 Design Philosophy

White space is essential

Avoid visual clutter

Avoid harsh or saturated colors

Avoid heavy shadows

Use rounded components

Use soft pastel tones

2.3 Interface Tone
The UI must not resemble:

Government portals

Hospital ERP systems

Dark fintech dashboards

Aggressive medical emergency systems

The UI must resemble:

Modern health-tech startup app

Preventive wellness platform

AI-powered monitoring system

COLOR SYSTEM (PASTEL LIGHT THEME)

Primary Color Palette:

Primary Blue: #7EA6F7
Secondary Blue: #5B7BEA
Accent Light Blue: #CFE0FF
Background: #F4F7FB
Card Background: #FFFFFF

Text Primary: #1F2937
Text Secondary: #6B7280

Status Colors (Soft Pastel Only):

Low Risk: #86E3A3
Moderate Risk: #FFD580
High Risk: #FF9C9C

Strict Rules:

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

Font Family:

Clean sans-serif (Inter or equivalent modern sans-serif)

Hierarchy:

Page Title: 22–24px, weight 600
Section Title: 18px, weight 600
Card Title: 16px, weight 500
Body Text: 14px, weight 400
Caption Text: 12px, weight 400

Spacing:

Use comfortable line height (1.5–1.6).

Maintain visual breathing room between sections.

MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN STRATEGY

5.1 Base Design Width
Primary design reference: 375px–430px width.

All layouts must be designed for mobile first. Scaling to larger devices must happen progressively.

5.2 Responsive Breakpoints

Mobile: 0–767px
Tablet: 768–1023px
Desktop: 1024–1439px
Large Desktop: 1440px+

5.3 Layout Adaptation Rules

Mobile:

Vertical stacked layout

Single-column structure

Cards stacked with consistent spacing

Tablet:

Two-column grid layout

Balanced spacing

Maintain card integrity

Desktop:

Three or four column grid

Dashboard-style alignment

Maintain white space

No fixed pixel widths for layout containers. Use responsive units.

DESIGN FLOW – SCREEN STRUCTURE

Step 1: App Entry Screen

Soft background (#F4F7FB)

Greeting section

Circular profile avatar

Optional soft gradient header area

Step 2: Dashboard Overview

Primary metric card (large card)

Health summary indicators

Risk status display

Trend visualization placeholder

Step 3: Health Metrics Section
Each metric must be placed inside a card with:

Border radius: 20–24px

Padding: 16px

Subtle elevation

Soft shadow only

Card Structure:

Icon or small illustration

Metric name

Current value

Risk badge

Small trend indicator

Step 4: Detailed View (Metric Drilldown)

Large title

Graph section

Historical data section

Recommendations section

Step 5: Alerts and Notifications

Soft alert cards

Pastel background tone depending on risk

No flashing or aggressive styles

Step 6: Profile and Settings

Clean structure

Minimal labels

ILLUSTRATION AND ICONOGRAPHY

Use:

Flat pastel illustrations

Minimal line-based icons

Rounded icon containers

Friendly medical visuals

Avoid:

Realistic medical photography

High contrast illustrations

Complex 3D medical graphics

Icons must be simple, thin-line, modern.

SPACING SYSTEM

Use an 8px grid system:

8px – micro spacing
16px – standard spacing
24px – section spacing
32px – major separation

Never overcrowd UI elements. Maintain consistent padding and margin values.

MICRO-INTERACTIONS

Smooth fade-in animations

Soft card hover elevation (desktop only)

Subtle scaling on tap

Smooth progress animations

Animation duration: 200–300ms

Easing: ease-in-out

Avoid:

Bounce effects

Flashing alerts

Over-animated transitions

ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1

Large tap targets (minimum 44px height)

Risk indicators must include icon + text, not color only

Maintain readable font sizes

STRICT DESIGN RESTRICTIONS

The agent must not:

Introduce dark mode unless explicitly requested

Use saturated or neon colors

Add excessive gradients

Create heavy shadows

Overcrowd layout

Mix multiple design styles

The agent must maintain visual consistency across all screens.

FINAL DESIGN VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before generating any UI output, verify:

Mobile-first layout structure

Proper pastel color usage

Consistent border radius

Consistent spacing system

Typography hierarchy maintained

Clean minimal visual flow

Fully responsive layout logic

If any of the above conditions are not met, the design is considered invalid.
